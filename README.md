# MotoCare Service Tracker

MotoCare Service Tracker is a full-stack motorcycle service workflow app built as a QA Automation portfolio project. It focuses on service-job lifecycle management, backend-driven state transitions, filtering, persistence, and end-to-end reliability.

**Live app:** https://motocareservice.petromirkolev.com/

---

## What this project demonstrates

- building and testing a stateful full-stack workflow app
- frontend and backend validation working together
- backend-driven job status transitions
- Playwright E2E and API coverage
- CI execution through GitHub Actions
- testability-focused design: stable data-testid selectors, reusable Page Objects, isolated test data, and Dockerized local runs
- real deployment with **Render + Neon**, plus local source-based and Docker-based test workflows

---

## Features

### Authentication

- User registration
- User login
- Logout
- Auth persistence across refresh
- Per-user data isolation

### Bikes

- Add bikes
- Delete bikes
- Bike list persistence across refresh
- Empty state handling
- Per-user bike isolation
- Derived bike readiness state:
  - **Ready** if no open jobs exist
  - **Not ready** if at least one related open job exists

### Service jobs

- Create service jobs for a selected bike
- View jobs list
- Persist jobs across refresh
- Per-user job isolation
- Per-bike job association

### Job statuses

MotoCare Service Tracker supports these statuses:

- "requested"
- "approved"
- "in_progress"
- "done"
- "cancelled"

![MotoCare Service Tracker job progress flow](docs/completejob.gif)

Allowed transitions:

- "requested > approved"
- "requested > cancelled"
- "approved > in_progress"
- "approved > cancelled"
- "in_progress > done"

Invalid transitions are rejected by the backend and covered by automated tests.

### Filtering

Jobs can be filtered by status:

- All
- Requested
- Approved
- In Progress
- Done
- Cancelled

### Integrity behavior

- Deleting a bike removes its related jobs
- Bike readiness updates based on job state
- Job status changes affect bike readiness correctly

## Tech stack

- **Frontend:** Vite + Vanilla TypeScript
- **Backend:** Node.js + Express + TypeScript
- **Database:** PostgreSQL (local Docker for development/tests, Neon in production)
- **Containerization:** Docker + Docker Compose
- **Testing:** Playwright
- **CI:** GitHub Actions
- **Deployment:** Render + Neon

## Project structure

```text
/web    -> frontend client (Vite + TypeScript)
/api    -> backend REST API (Node + Express + TypeScript)
/tests  -> Playwright API + UI tests
/docs   -> screenshots / assets
Local   -> frontend/backend from source + PostgreSQL in Docker
Docker  -> full local containerized stack
Prod    -> Render + Neon deployment
```

## Test coverage

The Playwright suite currently covers:

### Auth

- registration happy path
- duplicate registration
- invalid credential handling
- login happy path
- invalid login cases

### Bikes

- create bike
- delete bike
- validation rules
- user isolation

### Jobs

- create job
- validation rules
- persistence after reload
- filter behavior
- allowed status transitions
- bike isolation
- user isolation

## API coverage

The project includes both Playwright E2E tests and Playwright API tests.

### Auth API

- register success
- duplicate email rejection
- validation checks
- login success
- invalid login rejection

### Bikes API

- create bike success
- validation errors
- delete bike success
- integrity checks

### Jobs API

- create job success
- status transition rules
- filtering-related behavior
- integrity rules

At the time of writing, the suite contains **90 Playwright tests** (270 executions across Chromium, Firefox, and WebKit).

## How tests are run

Playwright is initialized at the repo root because tests target the whole system, not just the frontend.

The project supports two execution modes:

- **Local** - frontend/backend run from source on the machine, PostgreSQL runs in Docker
- **Docker** - frontend/backend/database all run in Docker

### Run Playwright locally

```bash
npm install
npm run db:create
npm run db:up
npm run test:local
npm run db:down
```

### Other available commands

```bash
npm run test:local:ui

```

### Run against Dockerized app

```bash
npm run test:docker:fresh
```

Or step by step:

```bash
npm run db:test:reset
npm run docker:test:up
npm run docker:test
npm run docker:test:down
```

### Running locally

MotoCare Service Tracker supports a local development setup where:

- **API** runs from source on your machine
- **frontend** runs from source on your machine
- **PostgreSQL** runs in Docker

### Environment files

The API uses separate environment files for local development and automated tests.

Example local development values:

```text
PORT=3001
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://postgres:postgres@localhost:5432/motocare_service_dev
TEST_DATABASE_URL=postgresql://postgres:postgres@localhost:5432/motocare_service_test
NODE_ENV=development
```

### Start PostgreSQL

```bash
npm run db:up
```

### Terminal 1 — API

```bash
cd api
npm install
npm run dev
```

### Terminal 2 — Web

```bash
cd web
npm install
npm run dev
```

Then open the frontend URL shown in the terminal.

## Run with Docker

```bash
docker compose up --build
```

### App URLs

- **Frontend**: http://localhost:4173
- **API**: http://localhost:3001

Stop containers with:

```bash
docker compose down
```

## Deployment

**Frontend**: Render Static Site
**Backend**: Render Web Service
**Database**: Neon PostgreSQL

## CI

GitHub Actions runs the Playwright suite on push and pull request.

## Notes

Hosted on free-tier infrastructure, so the first request may be slower due to cold starts.
